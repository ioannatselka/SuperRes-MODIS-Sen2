## A Deep Learning Approach to Image Resolution Enhancement: Super-Resolution of Multispectral MODIS Imagery Utilizing Sentinel-2 Products

This repository contains the implementation of my Masterâ€™s Thesis, focusing on enhancing the resolution of Earth Observation (EO) imagery using state-of-the-art Super-Resolution (SR) deep learning models. The project aims to super-resolve low-resolution MODIS imagery by leveraging high-resolution Sentinel-2 data, enabling cost-effective and accurate generation of high-resolution EO datasets for various environmental and scientific applications.

The models implemented include SRCNN, FSRCNN, EDSR, ESPCN, MRUNeT, and VDSR, evaluated across downscaling factors of x2, x4, and x8. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the potential of SR techniques to improve data clarity, edge definition, and structural fidelity, with MRUNeT achieving the best performance.
