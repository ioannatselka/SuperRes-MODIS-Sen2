# SuperRes-MODIS-Sen2

*A Deep Learning Approach to Image Resolution Enhancement: Super-Resolution of Multispectral MODIS Imagery Utilizing Sentinel-2 Products (Tselka I., 2024)*

---

## Overview

This repository contains the full implementation of my Masterâ€™s Thesis, which explores the use of deep learning models to enhance the spatial resolution of Earth Observation (EO) imagery.  
You can access the full thesis [here](https://dspace.lib.ntua.gr/xmlui/handle/123456789/60512).

## Models Implemented

The following state-of-the-art Super-Resolution models are implemented and evaluated:

- **SRCNN**: Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network
- **FSRCNN**: Fast SRCNN
- **EDSR**: Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
- **ESPCN**: Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Network
- **MRUNet**: Multi-Resolution U-Net (custom)
- **VDSR**: Very Deep Super-Resolution

- **Dataset**: The FLOGA dataset pairing MODIS and Sentinel-2 imagery, preprocessed and aligned. You can access the dataset [here](https://github.com/Orion-AI-Lab/FLOGA).
- **Super-Resolution Scales**:
  - `x2`: Upsampling from 500m â†’ 240m
  - `x4`: Upsampling from 500m â†’ 120m
  - `x8`: Upsampling from 500m â†’ 60m
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
  - SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)

## Brief discussion

#### Model Ranking Summary (by PSNR/SSIM)

| Rank | Model   | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
|  1   | MRUNeT  | Best overall across all scales and bands |
|  2   | VDSR    | Strong in SWIR/NIR; good general performance |
|  3   | EDSR    | Competitive on Ã—2 and Ã—4 scales |

> ðŸ“Œ Based on both visual and quantitative evaluations, **MRUNeT** is the most effective model for super-resolving MODIS imagery in this study.
